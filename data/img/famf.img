Family Food
DSC_0682.JPG

This picture symbolizes the food that my father cooks, as these recipes have been passed down my family for decades, my father has always been great at cooking, and I wanted to take a picture of my family traditions.

For this picture, I wanted a closeup of the food to get as much detail as possible, and I was able to get the camera to focus on the center of the food, causing a slight blur
