A Restored Beauty
DSC_0840.jpg

I took this photo to setup my camera for beach photos, and I realized that it was probably not too far gone. I used this photo for a post-processing assignment, by adjusting the contrast, brightness, and exposure to restore the colors to the photo.
I created a mask of the subjects, like the flag, chairs, etc, and removed the original background (which was a bit of a hassle), but after all this, I was able to add the background, gave it a few edits, and I was good.
