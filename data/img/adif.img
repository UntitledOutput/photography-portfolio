IMG_2479.JPG

This picture symbolizes my future, as I want to work in Computer Science, so this picture really encapsulates not only my future but also the future of computer science as many companies are moving to virtual reality.

For this picture, I wanted the reflection on the table to really pop, and while I should have used some flash to lighten the photo, the overhead lighting may have been enough.
