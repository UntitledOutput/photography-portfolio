This picture symbolizes what is important to my immediate family, as it shows the bookcases, which symbolizes how education is highly important to them, it also shows the art which my parents really appreciate, It also shows my brotherâ€™s high school diploma, which also symbolizes how education is important. On the bottom of the photo, you can see how there are board games and such, which show that even though live can get serious, always remember to have a little fun.
