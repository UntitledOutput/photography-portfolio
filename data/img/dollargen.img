Homogenity

In this photo, I was taking photos of rural Delaware, and I was on a trip to the beach. I had realized that there were many shopping centers in these rural areas, yet most people went to Dollar General for most of their groceries. There were supermarkets, farmers markets, and so many other, arguably better options. However, it was somewhat unusual to me, as it was like this across the state.
