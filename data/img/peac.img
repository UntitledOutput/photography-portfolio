Peacocks
IMG_2485.JPG

This picture symbolizes my early-life values, as I remember asking my mother about this painting that she has had since I’ve been born, and she would always tell me that her favorite animal was peacocks. Eventually, one day in elementary school, a peacock walked by the cafeteria windows, as there were zookepers there for a special event. Since then, peacocks have had a special place in my heart as I’ll never forget that core memory.
