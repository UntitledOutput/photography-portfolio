Checking Her Sources
DSC_0759.JPG

This picture symbolizes just how hard working my mother is, as I get inspiration from her hard work ethic, as she is always working, willing to help anyone, and is able to juggle her job life and family life seamlessly.
For this picture, I wanted a silhouette, but it was unfortunately blocking out most of the details I wanted in the photo. So I ended up having a slight silhouette thanks to the light behind her.
