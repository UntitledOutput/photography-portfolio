Staying Focused
DSC_0761.JPG

This photo is similar to my "Staying Focused" photograph, as it was taken shortly after it. I used another photo from this shoot because this highlights just how much of an inspiration my mother is for me. She has always told me to never procrastinate, and to give everything you do 100% of your effort, and while I have procrastinated and have treated certain things halfly, I always think, "what would my mother do?" when I get stuck with an assignment or a project I have.
