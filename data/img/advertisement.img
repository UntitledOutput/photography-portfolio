DSC_0853.jpg

I originally took this photo of a plane flying by, which was waving an advertisement for amish-built houses. Now, of course, I had never even heard of an amish built house, and thought it would be great to snap a picture.
However, the picture was taken at the beach during a cloudy day, which caused the colors to be muted, which led me to post process the photo by changing the contrast, brightness, and exposure.
I used the Lasso tool in Photoshop to make the plane bigger, and used the Content-Aware Fill tool to remove the original advertisement.
I had also wanted to make an unserious photo for my portfolio, and added some text to the new advertisement.
