Pidgeons
DSC_0855.JPG

I took this photo at the beach, and I was surprised to see pidgeons as there were only seagulls surrounding the area. We donâ€™t really have pidgeons in Maryland, so I was quick to take a photo of these for this assignment. This photo somewhat shows how wildlife seems to make an appearance anywhere.
