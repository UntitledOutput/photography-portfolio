An Innocent Childhood
BelPrePhoto2.JPG

This picture symbolizes community for me, as it shows my first elementary school, where many of my teachers still reside, and where I met many of my friends that I still have today.

For this picture, I wanted a slightly 2000s-esque look, with the high exposure and the low flash compensation.
