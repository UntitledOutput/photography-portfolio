I took this photo in Delaware, and it made me realize how the town i was in (Rehoboth) was somewhat an outcast when compared to its bordering towns. I elaborated on this more in the other Street genre pictures, but there were so many outlets, and stores, in an area that was surrounded by literal farmland.
