Perching For Food

I waited for around 10-15 minutes for one of the seagulls to stay in a specific position, as they had been flying around the beach for a while. While they were flying around, I had realized that the main reason behind why they were flying around was for food. There was a boardwalk right across from where I was sitting, which had the most stores and restaurants that Iâ€™ve ever seen in a single place. I took this photos with the assignment in mind, so I was trying to think about why they were perching. I assumed that this was a decisive moment for them, as around the time of me taking this photo, more people began coming back from the stores with food, so I assumed they were deciding who to barrage first.
