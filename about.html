        Now that I have taken both Photography 1A and 1B, I don't think that Photography is a great career for me. 
        I've tried all of the other methods, post processing was fun, and the entire class was fun, as it gave me something to do during the summer.
        However, I don't think I would want to do this for the rest of my life, or even as a hobby. Maybe once in a while now that I know how to work a camera and get the result I want, but actually taking commercial/professional photos probably isn't for me.

        <br><br>
        I started this course in the summer, with my Dad's camera, and I had no idea how to even use it. I was in the first online class session, and was trying to figure out the camera while my teacher <i>(Hi Mr. Perrone!)</i> was talking. Eventually after the class, I began snapping photos, and quickly got the hang of it. I started taking photos around my house as it had been late at night, and realized that this course wasn't going to be a breeze like the other courses I had taken.
        As the course went on, I began looking at other photographers, from Henri Cartier-Bresson to Annie Leibovitz, and their work was breathtaking, and inspired me to step up my work.

        <br><br>
        Like I stated, I don't feel like photography will be a major factor in my life, but now that I at least know how to work a camera, I would probably bring my camera to family vacations and such now, just to take a few pictures for some memories.
